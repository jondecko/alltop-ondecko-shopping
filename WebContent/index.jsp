			<p>Temp "home page" for the "Altop - Ondecko" shopping cart application.  Prepare to be amazed!
			Debbie Altop and Jimmy Ondecko are working together in the Franklin University COMP461 class.  Together they are building a 
			shopping cart application that works just like many popular shopping carts that can be found on the internet (Amazon, Newegg, etc).</p>
			<p>For now, the pages are linking to every page that has been identified through the "Use Case" phase of the project.  This type of navigation will 
			be cleaned up as the project progresses and the proper interaction, between the pages, is discovered.  Till then, the professor can enjoy some easy browsing!
